* Intent

I'm using [[https://adventofcode.com/][advent of code]] as an opportunity to learn Rust. I have never written Rust in anger, so please don't take these answers as indicative of how one should.

* Learning goals

I'm going to try to add a new technique each day; so using Rust at all on day one, reading inputs from a file on day two, using Structs on day three, and so on.
